This document contains the step by step approach of testing for a user. 

#Outcome
• Use the sudo command to switch to the root user and access the interactive shell as
root without knowing the password of the superuser.
• Explain how the su and su - commands affect the shell environment through running or
not running the login scripts.
• Use the sudo command to run other commands as the root user.

a) SSH into your machine and make sure you are logged in with regular user.
b) Run id in terminal to see the output of the current user. 
c) Run pwd to check the current directory. 
d) Check the HOME variable by running echo $HOME
e) Check the PATH variable by running echo $PATH

-- Now switch to root in non-login shell.

@ use sudo su command. 

Follow the same commands and compare the output.
- Now exit from the root non-login. 

-- Now switch to root user as login shell. 
Check the same and compare the output to observe the difference.
